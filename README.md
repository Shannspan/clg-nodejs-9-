CLG Node JS Lesson 9

NOTE: Mongodb & Postman have been included as files for assessment purposes only

*   Build a new API endpoint for the expense tracker

    *   Design the schema

*   Update the controller to add CRUD operations

*   Observe the database updates

Learning Objectives

*   Practice using API endpoints from Node.js

*   Create an API and perform CRUD operations on the stored data in Mongodb

OUTSTANDING ISSUE: 

*   While my code, Mongodb and Postman are interacting correctly - I am still receiving error massages in response body for POST requests in Postman - despite the POST actually updating or adding as designed.

            <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Cannot POST /expense/list</pre>
</body>
</html>

*   Manual testing of file paths excludes them as source of error at this stage

*   Further investigation will be needed to determine cause
