Lesson 9 Code Demo - any advice greatly appreciated! 

If you have time to review my code and can see an error that may be impacting, I appreciate any feedback! 

NOTE: I am using Windows

*** Connection of all elements results in an empty array 
eg 

[] (This is all that shows)

displaying in: 


* Browser - localhost:3000/expense/list 

and

* Postman / GET - localhost:3000/expense/list 

I have tried reinstalling MongoDB and it has not changed the outcome. 

I can see the DB data entries in the mongoshell as well when I use 
$db.expense.find()
just can't get them to display in the browser or postman
